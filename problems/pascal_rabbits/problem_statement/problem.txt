Problem 7: Pascal's Rabbits
---

Statement
---
in a laboratory to study animals reproduction, rabbits are distributed in  cells according to their races .
it was observed that if all rabbits(x) in a single cell (Ci) mate with total(y) of the adjacent cell(Ci+1) will give birth
to the sum of robbits in those cells( X+Y of bunny) conserving the initial numbre of this last in each race
('x' bunny of the race 'Ci' + 'Y' bunny of the race 'Ci+1' ).


Input
---
the 1st line contains two space separated integers N and K,
where N is the number of initial cells,
and K is the index of rabbits race that we want to figure out how many they are in the final cell.
the 2nd line contains N space separated integers represent the number of rabbits in the initial cells

Output
---
You will print a single line contains the number of rabbits with the kth gene in the final cell.
