int flow , //water flow 

int n_valves, // the number of valves

string valves_bandwidth, // line of bandwidths of every valve   (Liter/Second)

string delays , // line of delays between valves 

give the number of the  valve that can distribute the water flow in  the shortest time  

flow = "300"

valves_bandwidth = "1 2 4"
---
delays  = "50 50"
