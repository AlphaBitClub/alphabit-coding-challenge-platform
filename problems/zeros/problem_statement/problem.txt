---

Statement
---
Yasmine hates math, whenever it comes to calculations, she just loses it !
She finds a real trouble when it comes to zeros ! When it comes to addition, she can make her way out, but when it comes to multiplications she gets easily overwhelmed !
As you might have guessed, your job is to help Yasmine to count the trailing zeros (the zeros on the right side of the number).
Given a set of N integers, can you find the number of trailing zeros of the multiplication Xi integers.
Note: N can be a large number.

Input
---
1st line: N number of the integers.
The next N lines: Each contains a single integer Xi

Output
---
Number of trailing zeros
