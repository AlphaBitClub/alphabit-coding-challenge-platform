Problem: Even Ones
---

Statement:
---
Given a sequence of 1s(ex: 11111), you need to find if we can split this sequence into two smaller sequences where both of them contain an even number of 1s.

Input:
---
n: number, the length of the sequence.

Output:
---
YES or NO depends on if its possible to split the sequence.

Examples:
---
n == 3  NO
n == 4  YES
n == 6  YES

PS:
---
The challenge seems very easy, it looks like you just need to test if n is even or not, but note that when n == 2 you can't split the sequence even thought n is even in this case
